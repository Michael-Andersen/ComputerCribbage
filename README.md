# ComputerCribbage
ComputerCribbage is a project by Michael Andersen for playing the card game Cribbage against a computer opponent via the Command Line.
While it's fully functional, it is still a work in progress with the aim of being more user friendly. Hopefully, this process will
eventually lead to a GUI desktop program rather than it's current state as a console App.
This is a project created for educational and entertainment purposes.
